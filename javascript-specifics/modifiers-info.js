/*

    /g enables "global" matching. When using the replace() method, specify this modifier to replace all matches, rather than only the first one.
    /i makes the regex match case insensitive.
    /m enables "multi-line mode". In this mode, the caret and dollar match before and after newlines in the subject string.
